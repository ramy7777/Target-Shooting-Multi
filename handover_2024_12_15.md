# WebXR Multiverse Development Handover
**Date: December 15, 2024**

## Summary of Changes and Improvements

### 1. Terrain Model Implementation
- Replaced the programmatic shader-based terrain with a 3D model (`dirt terrain1.glb`)
- Adjusted terrain positioning:
  - Set scale to match previous 40-unit ground size
  - Fine-tuned Y-position to -0.7 units for proper alignment with trees
  - Maintained the same boundary size for gameplay consistency

### 2. Performance Optimizations
- **Memory Management**:
  - Implemented material reuse through `this.materials` Map
  - Added proper cleanup methods for geometries and materials
  - Added object tracking for proper disposal
  - Removed unused shadow calculations and rendering

- **Renderer Optimizations**:
  - Capped pixel ratio to 2 for better performance on high-DPI displays
  - Enabled high-performance mode
  - Added physically correct lights
  - Removed shadow map calculations

### 3. Code Organization
- Improved code structure in World.js:
  - Added cleanup methods for proper resource management
  - Implemented shared materials for similar objects
  - Better organization of object initialization and management

## Issues Resolved
1. **Performance Issues**:
   - Removed shadow calculations that were impacting performance
   - Implemented material sharing to reduce GPU memory usage
   - Added proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks

2. **Terrain Alignment**:
   - Fixed terrain positioning through iterative adjustments
   - Ensured proper alignment with existing trees and environment

## Current State
- All changes are committed and pushed to the `birds-model` branch
- Performance improvements are in place
- Terrain model is properly integrated and positioned
- Bird system is functioning as intended with proper networking
- Voice chat system operational with toggle support
- Score system synchronized across all players
- Game flow control working with proper network integration

## Network Protocol Details
1. **Game State Messages**:
   ```javascript
   {
     type: 'gameStart',
     data: {
       timestamp: Date.now(),
       settings: { duration: 300000, maxBirds: 6 }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Bird Sync Messages**:
   ```javascript
   {
     type: 'birdSpawned',
     data: {
       id: 'uuid',
       position: [x, y, z],
       direction: [x, y, z],
       movementParams: {
         radius: 30,
         angularSpeed: 0.0004,
         verticalSpeed: 0.0005,
         baseHeight: y
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Voice Chat Messages**:
   ```javascript
   {
     type: 'voice_ready',
     playerId: 'uuid',
     data: {
       offer: RTCSessionDescription,
       iceCandidate: RTCIceCandidate
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Score Update Messages**:
   ```javascript
   {
     type: 'scoreUpdate',
     data: {
       playerId: 'uuid',
       score: number,
       timestamp: Date.now()
     }
   }
   ```

## Next Steps
1. Monitor performance metrics after these changes
2. Consider further optimizations if needed
3. Test terrain collision with the new model
4. Verify multiplayer synchronization with the new terrain
5. Test voice chat system under high latency conditions
6. Validate score synchronization in large sessions
