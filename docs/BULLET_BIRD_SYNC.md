# Bullet Visibility, Bird Synchronization, and Particle Effects

This document details the implementation and troubleshooting of three key features in our WebXR multiplayer game: bullet visibility across clients, bird synchronization, and particle effects for bird destruction.

## 1. Bullet Visibility

### Initial Problem
- Bullets were only visible to the player who shot them
- Other players in the same room couldn't see bullets being fired
- Particle effects weren't showing when bullets hit birds

### Root Causes
1. **Message Type Mismatch**
   - Client was sending 'bulletSpawned' messages
   - Server was expecting 'bulletCreated' messages
   - This mismatch caused messages to be ignored

2. **Duplicate Bullet Spawning**
   - Bullets were being spawned twice:
     1. Once when the local player shot
     2. Again when receiving the network message

### Solution
1. **Message Type Standardization**
   ```javascript
   // Server-side: Changed message handler
   case 'bulletSpawned':
       broadcastToRoom(client.roomCode, {
           type: 'bulletSpawned',
           senderId: client.id,
           data: data.data
       }, ws);
   ```

2. **Sender ID Validation**
   ```javascript
   // Client-side: Added sender check
   handleNetworkBulletSpawn(data, senderId) {
       // Don't spawn bullets for our own shots
       if (senderId === this.engine.networkManager.localPlayerId) {
           return;
       }
       // Spawn bullet for other players' shots
       const bullet = new Bullet(/*...*/);
   }
   ```

## 2. Bird Synchronization

### Initial Problem
- Birds weren't spawning consistently across clients
- Bird positions and movements weren't synchronized
- Bird destruction wasn't visible to all players

### Implementation
1. **Spawn Coordination**
   - Only the host spawns birds
   - Host sends 'birdSpawned' messages with:
     - Initial position
     - Movement parameters
     - Unique ID

2. **Movement Synchronization**
   - Birds use deterministic movement patterns
   - All clients calculate the same orbits using shared parameters:
     - Orbit radius: 30 units
     - Boundary size: 60 units
     - Height range: 2-15 units

3. **Lifespan Management**
   ```javascript
   // Bird.js
   constructor() {
       this.lifespan = 15000; // 15 seconds
       this.creationTime = Date.now();
   }
   ```

## 3. Particle Effects

### Initial Problem
- Particle effects weren't showing when birds were destroyed
- Effects weren't synchronized across clients
- Some effects persisted longer than intended

### Implementation
1. **Particle System Creation**
   ```javascript
   // Bird.js
   hit(damage, hitPosition) {
       if (this.health <= 0) {
           const particleSystem = new ParticleSystem(
               this.position.clone(),
               0xff0000,  // Red color
               20         // 20 particles
           );
           this.parent.add(particleSystem);
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Particle System Management**
   - Particle systems are tracked in BirdManager
   - Automatic cleanup after animation completes
   - Network synchronization of destruction events

### Best Practices
1. **Network Message Handling**
   - Use consistent message types
   - Include sender IDs to prevent duplicates
   - Validate messages before processing

2. **Resource Management**
   - Clean up particle systems after use
   - Remove birds after lifespan expires
   - Clear bullets when they hit or expire

3. **Debug Logging**
   ```javascript
   console.debug('[DEBUG] Spawning network bullet from player:', senderId, data);
   console.debug('[DEBUG] Bird killed at position:', position.toArray());
   ```

## Testing
1. **Bullet Visibility**
   - Connect multiple clients
   - Fire bullets from different positions
   - Verify visibility across all clients

2. **Bird Synchronization**
   - Check bird positions match across clients
   - Verify bird destruction is synchronized
   - Ensure new birds spawn correctly for all players

3. **Particle Effects**
   - Confirm effects appear for all players
   - Check effect cleanup
   - Verify performance with multiple effects

## Future Improvements
1. **Network Optimization**
   - Batch updates for multiple birds
   - Implement delta compression
   - Add prediction for smoother movement

2. **Visual Enhancements**
   - Customize particle effects per bird type
   - Add hit feedback effects
   - Improve destruction animations

3. **Performance**
   - Pool particle systems for reuse
   - Optimize bird movement calculations
   - Add level-of-detail for distant effects
